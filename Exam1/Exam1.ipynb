    "February 22, 2022 was a rare day that all five digits of the date, 22222, are twos. The string is both palindrome and symmetric. Recall that a sequence is said to be palindrome if one half of the string is the reverse of the other half, e.g., \"madam\". A sequence is said to be symmetrical if both halves of the string are the same, e.g., \"abcabc\". If the length of a sequence is an odd number, the middle element in the sequence is not considered. "
